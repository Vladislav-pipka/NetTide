# Privacy Policy for NetTide

**Last updated:** November 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how NetTide ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application (the "Service"). Our commitment is to your privacy, and we want to be transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Handle

NetTide is designed to help you manage your mobile network connections, particularly to avoid expensive roaming charges. To do this, the app needs to access certain information on your device.

**We want to be clear: NetTide does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to our servers or any third party.** All data processing is done locally on your device.

The information the app works with includes:

1.  **Mobile Carrier Information:**
    *   The app identifies the name and country of your current mobile network operator (e.g., "AT&T," "Vodafone UK").
    *   **How it's used:** This is the core functionality. The app uses this information to check if the current operator is on the list you have configured to be "blocked" or "allowed."
    *   **Storage:** This information is read in real-time and is **not** stored, logged, or saved.

2.  **User Configuration Data:**
    *   The app saves the list of network operators that you choose to block or allow.
    *   **How it's used:** This list is used by the app to decide when to trigger its features (like sending a notification or attempting to guide the network selection).
    *   **Storage:** This configuration is stored locally on your device's internal storage (`SharedPreferences`). It is **not** transmitted off your device.

## Permissions

To perform its function, NetTide may require the following permissions:

*   **Read Phone State / Access Network State:** This permission is necessary to identify your current mobile network operator. The app cannot function without it.
*   **Notifications:** To alert you when you connect to a network operator that you have marked for monitoring.

## No Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties. Since we do not collect any personal or sensitive information, there is nothing for us to share.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service is intended for a general audience and is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
