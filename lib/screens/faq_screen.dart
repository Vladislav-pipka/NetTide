Instead, when you connect to a disabled operator, NetTide instantly activates a local VPN service on your phone, which blocks all internet data transmission.

Is my data being sent somewhere through the VPN?',            answer: 'Yes, it is completely safe. The VPN service runs only on your device and does not send your data anywhere. It acts as a \"firewall\" or a \"kill switch\": its only job is to block traffic for disabled networks, not to view or redirect it. This is a standard and secure Android mechanism.',          ),          FaqTile(            question: 'How do I know the app is working and protecting me?',            answer: 'There will be a persistent notification in your phone\'s status bar.

The actual roaming price depends on your home operator and your tariff plan. When you arrive in a new country, your operator usually sends an SMS with the exact rates. You can tap the price in the app to enter the correct value and make it accurate for you.',          ),          FaqTile(            question: 'What if I urgently need to use a blocked network?',            answer: 'It\'s simple.

The app will immediately disable the block for that network.',          ),          FaqTile(            question: 'Will the app drain my battery significantly?',            answer: 'Any app running in the background consumes some power, but NetTide is designed to be as energy-efficient as possible. It doesn\'t constantly check the network but \"wakes up\" only when the network changes (e.g., when disconnecting from Wi-Fi).
